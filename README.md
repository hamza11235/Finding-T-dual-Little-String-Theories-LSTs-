# Generating T-dual Heterotic Little String Theories (LSTs)

This repository contains the code used to generate all the geoemtric examples of Heterotic LSTs, both twisted and untwisted, in [2311.02168](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.02168) and [2411.05313](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.05313). We use toric geometry, and hence the inputs are vertices of a _4D reflexive polytope_, which are in a one-to-one correspondence with _Calabi-Yau (CY) threedfolds_. Furthermore, we require a 4D reflexive polytope with at least one 2D reflexive subpolytope, which then ensures that we have at least one _genus-one fibration_ of the CY. Via _F-theory_, we then know that once we _decompactify_ this CY, we expect to realize certain _supersymmetric quantum field theories_, including Heteortic LSTs when the _base_ of the fibration is birational to $\mathbb{P}_{1}\times \mathbb{C}$. When a particular 4D reflexive polytope has multiple fibrations, we realize _T-dual_ LSTs, corresponding to each fibration. The code finds the different fibrations of a given 4D reflexive polytope and uses techniques in algebraic geometry to extract the corresponding LST, which we represent as a _quiver gauge theory_. The code is also equipped to handle the subtlety of _non-flat fibrations_. Finally, we also compute the _5D Coulomb Branch, 5D Flavor Rank, and the 2-group Structure Constants_ from the geoemtric data, and show that these match for T-dual LSTs, as expected.
