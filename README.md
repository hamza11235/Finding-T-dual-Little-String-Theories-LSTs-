# Generating Heterotic Little String Theories (LSTs)

This repository contains the code used to generate all the geoemtric examples of Heterotic LSTs, both twisted and untwisted, in [2311.02168](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.02168) and [2411.05313](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.05313). We use toric geometry, and hence the inputs are vertices of a _4D reflexive polytope_, which are in a one-to-one correspondence with _Calabi-Yau (CY) threedfold_. In particular, we require a 4D reflexive polytope with at least one 2D reflexive subpolytope, which then ensures that we have at least one _elliptic fibratin_ of the CY. The code then
